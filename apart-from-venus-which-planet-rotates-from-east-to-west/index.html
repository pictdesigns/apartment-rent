<h3 id="-venus-rotates-on-its-axis-in-the-opposite-direction-to">? Venus rotates on its axis in the opposite direction to</h3><p>The standard answer is that venus does rotate from east to west. Unlike the earth and most other planets, venus rotates on its axis from east to west, i.e. Will it be the same on venus? Retrograde motion is from east to west. Since your birth, how many times have you gone around the sun? Venus is the hottest planet with a temperature of about 450 degrees to 500 degrees celsius.</p>

<p>Why Do Venus and Uranus Spin The Wrong Way? I Love The, The sun does indeed rotate, but it does not rotate like the earth or other solid objects like our planet. As for venus, our closest neighbour, scientists have suggested that it started off. 025 earth days to complete a single rotation. Venus is also the closest planet to earth. Sun appears to rise in the east and set in the.</p>
