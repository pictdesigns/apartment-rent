<h3 id="-venus-rotates-on-its-axis-in-the-opposite-direction-to">? Venus rotates on its axis in the opposite direction to</h3><p>The standard answer is that venus does rotate from east to west. Unlike the earth and most other planets, venus rotates on its axis from east to west, i.e. Will it be the same on venus? Retrograde motion is from east to west. Since your birth, how many times have you gone around the sun? Venus is the hottest planet with a temperature of about 450 degrees to 500 degrees celsius.</p>

<p>Venus is covered with clouds, although the inside is red, That�s the opposite direction to earth�s rotation. Only two planets venus and uranus revolve around the sun from east to west i.e. Uranus, however, is rather unique that the planet is tilted almost 90° on its side, making its direction.
