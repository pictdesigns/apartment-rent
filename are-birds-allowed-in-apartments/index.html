<h3 id="nendo-treehouse-bird-apartment-domus">Nendo Treehouse bird apartment Domus</h3><p>Below is a list of other pets allowed in hdb flats: When it comes to birds, you want to make sure that you get a smaller bird that doesn�t make a lot of noise, meaning a huge parrot or macaw probably isn�t the best bird to have in an apartment. Base commanders and military housing companies hold the authority to make exceptions, but the gist is that no unusual animals can live in base housing. That depends where you live in, i suppose… if there are so many ‘no allowed pets’ apartments, then it must be much difficult for pet owners to find a new place… not everyone can afford a house (not an apartment). Pets should not display any aggressive behavior, and they must be registered and approved by the university’s office of residence life. Know the laws when it comes to keeping and raising pet birds.</p>
