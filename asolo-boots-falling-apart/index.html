I was recommended asolo fugitive gtx boots by a close buddy of mine that is an arborist and is on his 5th pair of these since 2007!? I think i will inject silicone into the gap and see what happens. So what you have left is the bare uppers. These boots are definitely defective. Don�t know where they used to make their boots, but now many of them are being made in romania, so quite possible their quality and qc has gone downhill.</p>
